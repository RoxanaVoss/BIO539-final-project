## BIO593 (Big Data Analysis) Final Project
### Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Behavior in existing Infrastructures
EV charging stations are installed based on interest or algorithms (i.e., simulations, optimizations) with very little to no user behavior or user expectations, which can lead to increased infrastructure costs further down the road. To accurately develop a customer-oriented charging station infrastructure requires knowledge of how users utilize the current EV stations and how that corresponds to their charging expectations. This research explores the patterns between how EV charging stations are being utilized in Rhode Island.

## Content
This repository provides a written proposal on research plans, a Rmarkdown version which explains briefly the data analysis and runs the analysis, and the raw data provided by the Office of Energy Resources with locations verified by ChargePoint.

## Data
The analysis works with a csv-file which contains data about charging events at Rhode Island stations. 
Updated data can be uploaded and implemented in the R script, all analysis should run the same way as with the previous version.
The Updated data should have the same format as the previous one (column names, number formatting)

## Statistical Outcomes
- Descriptive Statistics
- Descriptive Charts
- Map of user distribution

## Running tests
Download the R markdown.
Insert a new dataset or use the given data set.
Make sure the right data set is mentioned in the script.
Run the whole scrip or certain parts.

## Author
The project was completed by Roxana Voss.
